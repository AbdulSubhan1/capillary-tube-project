# Capillary Tube Simulation

<!-- Add a screenshot of your simulation here -->
<!-- ![Capillary Tube Simulation](public/screenshot.png) -->

An interactive 3D simulation demonstrating capillary action in glass tubes with different liquids. This educational tool allows users to explore how meniscus formation and capillary rise vary based on liquid properties.

## üîç Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Built with Three.js for realistic fluid dynamics representation
- **Multiple Liquid Types**: Choose between water, mercury, alcohol, and more to observe different behaviors
- **Adjustable Fill Levels**: Control the amount of liquid in the tube
- **Real-time Interaction**: Rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D model to examine from different angles
- **Educational Information**: Learn about the physical properties of different liquids and how they affect capillary action
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with app router for frontend
- **React 19**: UI component library
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library for web browsers
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **Drei**: Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- Yarn or npm package manager

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/capillary-tube-project.git
   cd capillary-tube-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the simulation.

## üß™ How It Works

The simulation demonstrates capillary action - the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity.

- **Concave Meniscus**: Liquids like water form a concave meniscus (curves upward at the edges) due to adhesive forces between the liquid and the glass being stronger than the cohesive forces within the liquid.
- **Convex Meniscus**: Liquids like mercury form a convex meniscus (curves downward at the edges) because the cohesive forces within the liquid are stronger than the adhesive forces with the glass.

The simulation allows you to explore these behaviors by changing liquid types and observing the differences in meniscus formation and capillary rise.
